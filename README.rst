Feature Selection for Clustering
================================

A library with algorithms for feature selection for clustering.

Based on the paper "Feature Selection for Clustering" by S. Alelyani, J. Tang and H. Liu

Uses high-dimensional datasets from http://cs.uef.fi/sipu/datasets/ for testing

Implemented algorithms:

- SPEC family - NormalizedCut, ArbitraryClustering, FixedClustering
- Sparse clustering - Lasso

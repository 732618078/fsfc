Base Classes and Mixins
=======================

FSFC uses some base classes and mixins, based on :mod:`sklearn` estimators and classifiers. It makes the library
fully compatible with :mod:`sklearn`, so feature selectors can be used in pipelines

Mixins
------
Some default mixins which extend ones defined in :mod:`sklearn`

.. automodule:: fsfc.mixins

Classes
-------
Base classes of all feature selecting / clustering algorithms of FSFC

.. automodule:: fsfc.base

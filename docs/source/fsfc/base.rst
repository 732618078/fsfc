Base Classes and Mixins
=======================

FSFC uses some base classes and mixins, based on :mod:`sklearn` estimators and classifiers. It makes the library
fully compatible with :mod:`sklearn`, so feature selectors can be used in pipelines


Classes
-------
Base classes of all feature selecting / clustering algorithms of FSFC

.. automodule:: fsfc.base


Mixins
------
Some default mixins which extends ones defined in **sklearn**

.. automodule:: fsfc.mixins
